# Lab 8 Android Application Lab

# Part 0: Android Studio

**Warning:** The emulators for Android take up a *lot* of disk space. Be sure you have at least 10G available!

### AndroidStudio Installation:

Install Android Studio from:

https://developer.android.com/studio

The current version is Android Studio Electric Eel (2022.1.1 Patch 2).

### Intellij:

If you want to try IntelliJ, make sure that your IntelliJ has the Android Support plugin installed; it should have been installed on the original download, but check anyway. Choose Preferences (or File-> Settings) -> Plugins, and click on the Installed tab. You should see Android Support already installed; if not, IntelliJ will prompt you to install it.

You'll also need the Android SDK installed. You can do this when you create the Hello Android project (but it might already be installed). It does *not* replace the Java SDK - you need that, too (at least JDK 16).

# Part 1 - Hello Android

# Create an Android Project in Android Studio

1. Choose "Create New Project" on the startup screen (later, if you have a project already open, do Choose File -> New -> Project like usual).
2. Choose the Phone and Tablet tab; click on the **Basic Activity** icon, then click Next.
3. Choose "HelloAndroid" as the project Name. This will change the Package name and Save location automatically.
4. Change the package name to something reasonable (e.g ds.edu.cmu.)
5. (Optional) Change the Save location by clicking the small file folder icon to bring up the FileChooser. You may need to enter a new directory name.
6. Change the language to "Java" - it might default to "Kotlin" or nothing.
7. Select Minimum SDK API 33 (Android 13 Tiramisu) and click Finish. (Choosing a higher level will result in fewer phones to choose from, but we'll be using an emulator.) Click Finish.
8. The "Completing Requested Actions" window will show next; wait for it to load everything, then click Finish. The default project will show up; the Gradle build may take a moment.

You will see an Android project in the IDE; it will take a few moments to build. It should be a fully-working "Hello Android" app.

**(Optional)** If you have multiple versions of the Java JDK installed - in particular, if you have 1.8 - it might default to an older version, which will not be compatible with the current version of the Android SDK. If you think that's an issue (you project doesn't build and the error message says you're using 1.8, say), then do this:

- on a Mac, click AndroidStudio->Settings->Build,Execution,Deployment->Build Tool ->Gradle
- click the down arrow at the end of the Gradle JDK field
- if jdk-17 shows up (16 is fine, too), click that; if not, click other, and (hopefully) all your JDK versions will show up: click jdk-17 and Open
- click Apply and OK

**(Optional)** If the Gradle Build errors out, check File->Project Structure -> Project. The Gradle Version should be 7.5 (plugin version is 7.4.2). For me, even though these seemed to be set correctly, I had to reset them before it would work. Then the Gradle build executed again, and all was good.

## Test Hello Android in the AVD

1. Click on the MainActivity.java tab to view the code.
2. Tiramisu will likely be the default showing in the box next to the green triangle. Keep this setting. But if you want to experiment with other devices, open the Device Manager by expanding dropdown menu next to the green triangle button and choosing Device Manager (at the bottom).
3. Click the green triangle.
4. Switch to the running AVD and verify that the Hello Android app has successfully launched. Note that it may take a few moments for the emulator's phone to boot up. The emulator should start as a separate program (it may be behind other windows). It should say "Hello First Fragment".

IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE with the emulator - in particular, if you get the message "Waiting for process to come online" and then it times out - try the fixes on this web site, one at a time:

https://www.technipages.com/android-emulator-stuck-waiting-for-target-to-come-online

IF THE ANDROID EMULATOR BOOTS UP BUT THE APP DOES NOT LAUNCH - check if you're using "Quick Boot": go to the Tools -> Device Manager; click the down arrow on the right side of your chosen virtual device, and choose Edit .

Click Show Advanced Settings. Scroll down to Emulated Performance and check "Cold Boot", not "Quick Boot". Click Finish. Then rebuild the app and run it again.

Look at the running app. **Note the background color of the bar** at the top of the first screen (mine is purple). Note the text fields and the button. Click the button to get to the second screen. Android apps typically use multiple fragments (they're like a UI sub-window) contained in the main UI component; each fragments show a view of one part of the app.

## Exercises

1. Explore the contents of the project's res directory. These are the static resource files that your Android app uses. They include such things as menus, user interface (UI) definitions, icons, and strings.
2. Expand res>layout to see the file strings.xml; this defines static strings that are used in your application. Change the string named "first_fragment_label", which currently should have the value "First Fragment", to your name (e.g. "Joe's App", with the escape character \ before the apostrophe). It is recommended practice to place String constants in this file instead of defining them in your code.
3. Save strings.xml
4. Examine res/layout/activity_main.xml. Notice that this is the UI definition of the main Activity. It does an "include layout" at the end for content_main. You'll likely be in "Design Mode" initially; change to "Code" using the button at the top right.
5. Edit res/layout/activity_main.xml. This is the part of the screen layout for the overall app. Change the color from colorPrimary to colorSecondary (it's in the widget.Toolbar section). Did you notice the background color when you ran it before? This will change to a different color; make sure it does!
6. Edit fragment_first.xml. In the Design view, in the Palette window, click on Text (right underneath Common). Click on "Plain Text" and drag a field onto your screen.
7. In the Attributes tab on the right, under the Properties of this widget, find the Declared Attributes, locate the "text" property, and reset the text value from "Name" to "Hello Android"
8. Save content_main.xml
9. Use the red square to stop the app (if it was running).
10. Click the green play triangle in the Android Studio menubar to run the app.
11. Choose the AVD you just created to run the app in.
12. Switch to the running AVD (if it doesn't show up, look at the margin on the right-hand side - "Emulator" should be here; click on it) and verify that the Hello Android app has successfully launched and your changes have been successful.

# Part 2 Interesting Picture

1. Download the zipped AndroidInterestingPicture from Canvas and unzip it.

2. Open Android Studio. **If you already have a window open from Part 1, close it.**

3. Choose File->New->Import Project. From the file chooser, choose the folder containing AndroidInterestingPicture.

4. **(Optional)** Choose "Import project from external model", then Android Gradle and click Finish. The project should open; navigate to app->src->main->java, where you'll see the package directory. Note: I did not have to do this step; not sure if you will.

5. Get a Flickr API key from: http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html

   Note: you will be asked to create a Yahoo account. Don't forget what you use as a password. Yep, a Yahoo account.

6. Edit the file GetPicture.java and put your API key where it says "<< put your Flickr api key here >>" (replace the << and >> also!). Remember to save the file.

7. Click the green play triangle in the Android Studio menubar to run the app.

8. Choose the AVD you just created to run the app in.

9. Switch to the running AVD and verify that the InterestingPicture app has successfully launched. Type in a keyword to search such as "boat" and click Submit and you should see a picture displayed.

Explore the project folders. The most important are the "java" and "res" folders. The java folder has the source code for the application, and the res folder has the static resources as you saw in Part 1.

Within the java folder, you will see two classes:

ds.cmu.edu.interestingpicture.InterestingPicture ds.cmu.edu.interestingpicture.GetPicture

Study the InterestingPicture class. Android applications are organized into "activities" and this is the main activity for this application. Read the comments and the code and understand how it works.

The GetPicture class is used to first search Flickr for a pictures related to a keyword, and then fetch a picture. So that the phone user interface is not frozen while these network activities take place, these network actions must take place in a helper thread. AsyncTask makes it easy to use a helper thread. Read the comments in GetPicture and review the AsyncTask API:

http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html

1. The application is missing the feedback "Here is a picture of a ..." or "Sorry, I could not find a picture of a..." a. Add a new TextView to res/layout/content_main.xml for this feedback b. In the pictureReady method, findViewById your new TextView c. Set the text of the TextView to the appropriate string (depending on whether the picture is found or not). (Where can you get the search term from to add to this string?)

2. Run and test it.

3. Sort the following list of methods into the order they are invoked when "submit" is clicked, and indicate whether they are being run in the "UI" thread or a helper thread. See for reference the AsyncTask API:

   http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html

   BackgroundTask.search

   doInBackground

   GetPicture.search

   getRemoteImage

   getRemoteXML

   onClick

   onPostExecute
