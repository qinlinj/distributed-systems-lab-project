# Lab 2 ‚Äì Interesting Picture

## Part 1

### 1. Review the Hello World web app, make sure it's working

Review the directions for installing the Hello World web app using TomEE9, Jakarta, and Java17 from Lab 1. Those directions are repeated in abbreviated form below.

### 2. Get the InterestingPicture web app working

a. Watch the Video, Interesting Picture for Lab 2, on Canvas.

b. Download the files InterestingPictureModel.java, InterestingPictureServlet.java, prompt.jsp, response.jsp, and web.xml (see below for where to copy these files into) from:

https://github.com/CMU-Heinz-95702/Lab2-InterestingPicture

c. Create a new web project in IntelliJ named InterestingPicture. If necessary, change the directory to put this project in a folder of your choosing. The project should be a Java Enterprise Web application project using TomEE 9 (note that it shows up as v. 10) using Java 16, Maven, and JUnit (which won't be needed); change the Group to ds (that's the package name); the name of the Artifact should be "InterestingPicture". Make sure to choose Jakarta EE 9 (*not* Java EE 8) and Servlet 5.0.0. The Jakarta choice is easy to miss; it may default to Java EE 8; failing to get this setting correct will cause the application to fail when you run it, so get this right!

d. Expand (in the Project window) src -> main -> java. Delete the HelloServlet.java file (right-click and choose Delete); also delete the ds.InterestingPicture package. Right-click on java and choose New->Package to create package ds. Then copy InterestingPictureModel.java and InterestingPictureServlet.java (from a Finder or FileExplorer window) and paste into package ds (right-click on ds and choose Paste).

e. Similarly, copy prompt.jsp and response.jsp into the webapp folder, and web.xml into the WEB-INF folder (choose "overwrite" because there's already a web.xml file there). Delete the index.jsp file from the webapp folder.

f. Choose the Run-Edit Configurations. Make sure TomEE 10 is showing. Click the Deployment tab; near the bottom (you may have to scroll down to see it), type

/InterestingPicture-1.0-SNAPSHOT

into the Application Context text field. Click Apply and OK. Finally, on the green triangle or choose Run/Run to build and run the program.

g. Make sure the app displays a prompt; choose a noun (like "cat"), click "Click Here", and ensure that a picture of a cat is displayed.

h. Try out a few other search terms. When finished, click the red square at the top right to quit the program.

### üèÅ **Checkpoint: show the working InterestingPicture web app to your TA.**

## Part 2

### 3. Practice debugging ‚Äì Using the debugger to explore how InterestingPicture works.

a. Put a breakpoint at the InterestingPictureModel::doFlickrSearch method before the searchTag is encoded at line 40 (click in the margin next to 40 - a red dot should appear).

b. On the Run menu, choose Debug (or click the green bug next to the arrow).

c. In the browser, search for the word zzzz8888

d. In the IntelliJ debugging variables window, confirm that the value of searchTag is what you typed in the browser, zzzz8888.

e. Right-click on that value and choose View/Edit. Change the value of searchTag to "peach"

f. On the Run menu, choose Debugging Actions, and Resume Program

g. In the browser, confirm the response from the web app has the message "Here is an interesting picture of a zzzz8888" but shows a picture of a peach.

### 4. In the model class, study how the fetch method words.

a. Why is a while loop used?

b. Put a breakpoint in the loop and examine the value of str with each iteration. What is the format of the information you are seeing?

### 5. Investigate how screen scraping works.

a. After the fetch loop completes, examine the value of **response** in the debugging window by clicking on View at the right-hand side of the box. Right-click and choose Copy Value; this copies this long string to the clipboard. Make sure you're doing this *after* the loop finishes, so you have all of the stuff stored in response (i.e., not where you put the breakpoint in part b).

b. Open a text editor and paste this string. Then search for the string used by response.indexOf() - that is, the parameter to indexOf().

c. Copy the string into a new browser tab to confirm that it is a picture url.

### 6. Add an *Easter Egg* in the web app.

(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)#Software)

a. In the result.jsp file, if the search word from Flickr is "Andy", then do not display the Flickr image. Instead, display the following image of Andrew Carnegie ten times:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Carnegie#/media/File:Andrew_Carnegie,_three-quarter_length_portrait,_seated,_facing_slightly_left,_1913-cropped(b).jpg

You *must* use an embedded Java loop for this part; do not simply replicate the image ten times.
